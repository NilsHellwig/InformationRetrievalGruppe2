        <h1>Task Description</h1>
        <p>Thank you for completing the questionnaire.</p>

        <p>During the course of the experiment you will be given 4 queries on different nutritional topics.
            For each of them you will see some search results. It's your task to provide a credibility rating for the
            information found on the website without having access to it. Credibility refers to the extend to which the
            content of a page can be considered to present unbiased, correct and balanced information.
            <br>
            Your credibility judgement will be given on a 11 point scale ranging from "very non credible" to "very credible".
            Please use the neutral option only if you have no idea what information the website could contain.</p>
        <p>Please note that we are only interested in the credibility of information found on the page that would open
            if you clicked on the search result, <b>not</b> in the general credibility of the whole website.</p>

        <p>The search results will look like the example below. They are based on the standard search results you are
            familiar with from search engines like Google. The search results <b>appear in a random order</b>, which
            means that there is no relationship between their order and their credibility.
            <br>It consists of:
            <ul>
                <li>the title of the website</li>
                <li>the url of the website</li>
                <li>two sentences that were extracted from the page that are representative for the page's content</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
