# Repository for Information Retrieval (Research Practice)

## Setup

First of all you need to clone this repository. We trained three classifiers:

1. Support Vector Machine + tf-idf for classification based on title (`train_content_classifier.ipynb`)
2. Support Vector Machine + tf-idf for classification based on content (`train_content_classifier.ipynb`)
3. Support Vector Machine for topic agonistic 
4. Support Vector Machine with vectors representing the frequency of certain advertising agencies on a website

Important: The results of each trained classifier's prediction can be found in `/predictions` in the format of a .json-file
